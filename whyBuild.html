            <span class="highlight pink">Did you know?</span>Building your own computer from parts is not just for
            nerds and PC enthusiasts anymore. With a little
            guidance and knowhow anyone can build a PC, your grandma, the captain of the football team, your
            neighbour, and even you! Yes <span class="highlight pink">YOU</span> can build a PC!!<br><br>

            <span class="highlight pink">Make it yours!</span> Building a custom PC gives you the ultimate freedom to
            make it exactly what you want it to be, from small
            form factor home theater PC to a behemoth custom water cooling gaming PC, you name it!<br><br>

            <span class="highlight pink">Save some dough!</span> Your money goes much further when building your own
            PC, you can get a cheaper computer or higher
            quality parts for the price of an off the shelf model.

            <span class="highlight pink">Look what you built!</span> Carefully choosing all your parts and assembling
            together yourself gives you a
            sort of pride, you made this! It also means you have a much better understanding of what each part do which
            will help you in the future when your PC starts to get dated and you want to upgrade parts of it.<br><br>

            <span class="highlight pink">Upgrading Parts!</span> With an off the shelf pre-built computer, most people
            never bother even opening it up to
            see whatâ€™s inside. This can often lead to people replacing the entire computer for an entire new system
            once it starts to show its age, this is wasteful, expensive, and unnecessary. As your custom build PC
            starts to show its age you are more likely to simply swap out the individual parts that need the upgrades
            overtime. You can have your very own continuously evolving and growing PC, they grow up so fast!<br><br>

            In the end you will save money, learn a new skill (maybe a new hobby?), and have a kick ass custom PC that
            will make your friends jealous.
