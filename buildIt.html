    <h2 class="stepNum step1" id="step1">Step 1</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step1">Prep the Motherboard</h3>
    <p class="step step1">The first thing I do with a new build is “prep” the motherboard, by this I mean install the
      CPU and
      its cooler
      before putting it in the case. To install the CPU simply unlatch the socket holder and remove the plastic
      protecting guard. Remove the CPU from its package, to handle it simply hold it by the sides, avoid touching the
      underside with all the pins. Looking at the chip you will see it has notches on some of the sides, this is to
      make installation easy, line up the notches with the ones on the motherboard and drop it in. You will not have
      to put pressure, if it doesn’t go in properly take it out and try again. Once the CPU is in its slot on the
      motherboard close and secure the latch.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step2" id="step2">Step 2</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step2">Install the memory stick(s)</h3>
    <p class="step step2">Most standard motherboards come with 2, 4, or 8 slots to install memory (RAM). Depending on
      the
      memory configuration you chose (2x4GB sticks, 1x8GB stick, 4x8GB sicks, etc.) your installation may very. When
      not filling up all the slots (2 ram sticks on a 4 slot motherboard for example) the slots you use will affect RAM
      speed. The best thing to do is look into the manual for the motherboard to see the optimal configuration. Usually
      this configuration skips a slot so slot 1 and slot 3 for example. To install simply match the notch in the
      connection with the ones on your ram slots then push until they click in.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step3" id="step3">Step 3</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step3">Install the CPU Cooler Bracket</h3>
    <p class="step step3">In many cases the CPU cooler needs to use the included bracket to mount on the motherboard.
        Many of these brackets need to access behind the motherboard, this is the reason I like to do this
        before mounting the motherboard in the case. Some cases offer a cut-out to access this part of the motherboard
        once mounted but not all. As there are many different types of coolers and brackets I will not cover exactly
        how to mount this, simply follow the provided instructions and you should be fine.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step4" id="step4">Step 4</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step4">Apply thermal paste and install the cooler</h3>
    <p class="step step4">Now that the cooler bracket is installed you are ready to apply the thermal paste. Most
      thermal paste will come in a syringe like tube, simply apply a pea size amount on the middle of the top part of
      the CPU, NOT on the pins.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step5" id="step5">Step 5</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step5">Install the motherboard inside the case</h3>
    <p class="step step5">It is now almost time to mount the motherboard in the case. Before mounting it you should
      look at your case fans positions and orientations. A common way to do this is to have all the fans in the front
      of the case used as air intake and all the fans towards the back/top as exhaust. Doing this allows for cool air
      to enter at the front and exhaust the hot air out the back. Also if you are using a water cooling block now is
      the time to decide where you will / can mount the radiator, intake or exhaust generally doesn’t make a huge
      difference for the radiator. Once all your fans are in place its time to mount the motherboard. <span class="highlight pink">!</span> Install
        the IO shield before mounting the motherboard. Lay the case flat on its back and line up the motherboard
        mounting holes with the ones inside the case. Use your magnetic screwdriver and slowly screw in the mounting
        screws, don’t overtighten them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step6" id="step6">Step 6</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step6">Install the power supply inside the case</h3>
    <p class="step step6">Look on the back of your case for the big square cut-out to find the location of your power
      supply, most new cases have it on the bottom but some on top. Route the power supply’s cables inside the case
      from the cut-out followed by the power supply itself, the switch should face the outside of the case. Add the
      four mounting screws and your done. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step7" id="step7">Step 7</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step7">Mount the hard drives in their bay</h3>
    <p class="step step7">All cases will over hard drive bays, most of them will also offer a removable tray. Match the
      mounting holes on the trays with the ones on your hard drive / SSD and secure them. Once on the trays slide /
      screw in the trays back in their position. <span class="highlight pink">!</span> Be mindful of where the connections are on the drive so that
        they are still accessible once mounted. All drives need a SATA connection and power from the power supply, the
        connections have unique size and a notch to prevent improper installation. Match these notches and plug in the
        power and SATA cable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step8" id="step8">Step 8</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step8">Plug in remaining components</h3>
    <p class="step step8">Now it is time to start routing all the cables to their final destinations. You should have
      fan connectors, SATA connector(s), case connectors, and power connectors at the minimum. Look at your
      motherboards manual for the locations of all the connections (The case connectors are the cables that come
      attached to your case to control the power button, usb, headphone jack, etc.). For the case fans, route the
      cables to their closest input pin on the motherboard and plug them in, use a splitter if you have more fans than
      connections. Follow the labels on the case connectors and match them to the motherboard manual, same with SATA.
      Now all you need to add is power, there should be a CPU 8 pin connector towards the top left corner and a 24 pin
      connector on the right side, connect these from your power supply (pin size and location may vary, check manual).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step9" id="step9">Step 9</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step9">Cable management</h3>
    <p class="step step9">Some people might say this is optional. The idea in this step is simply to tuck away all
      remaining cables, tie them down to the case and simply make your new system look good.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step10" id="step10">Step 10</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step10">Install GPU / other misc cards</h3>
    <p class="step step10">Almost done!! It is now time to install the graphics card and any other miscellaneous cards
      (like a WiFi card for example). If you don’t have any of these parts skip this step. The graphic card will almost
      always go in the first (top) PCIE slot. <span class="highlight pink">!</span> Before trying to insert the card into the slot make sure the
        back cover is removed from the case. Simply slid in the card into the slot until it clicks, that’s it!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step11" id="step11">Step 11</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step11">Clean up and post</h3>
    <p class="step step11">Sit the computer right side up and slide / screw on the side panels. The back panel may be a
      little harder to put on as this is usually where many extra cables get tucked away. Now plug in the power,
      screen, keyboard, and mouse. Cross your fingers and push the power button. Now you will probably have a mini
      panick attack as nothing happened, take a deep breath and check that the switch on the power supply is on. Repeat
      and exhale when it actually comes alive.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gridParent">
    <h2 class="stepNum step12" id="step12">Step 12</h2>
    <h3 class="stepTitle step12">Pat yourself on the back</h3>
    <p class="step step12">You did it, you built your first PC! Install your desired operating system and enjoy!</p>
