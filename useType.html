        <p class="mainText">
            Before diving into part selection we must first ask ourselves, what is the main purpose of this PC? Will
            this new PC be used in the living room as an all-in-one streaming device on your TV? Or maybe it will be
            used for video editing and rendering? Whatever the case may be, there are a few things to consider from the
            start
        </p>
        <p class="mainText"><span class="highlight pink">Budget</span> How much do you actually want to spend on this
            new system.
            Yes most of the time we can save money when building our own system but it is also very easy to
            purchase parts that may be overkill and blow through the budget.
        </p>
        <p class="mainText"><span class="highlight pink">Form Factor</span> Computer cases come in all shapes and
            sizes.
            Obviously there are pros and cons to having a very tiny case or a very large one. To make things
            simple we can thing of three main sizes: mini tower, mid tower and full tower (mid tower is the
            most common size).
        </p>
        <p class="mainText"><span class="highlight pink">Actual purpose of the PC</span> Computers can do just about
            anything now
            days but they must be built for the task. To simplify things I have broken this down into three
            main categories
        </p>
        <div class="basic userType">
            <img src="./imgs/SVG/basic.svg" alt="basic user" class="userTypeIcon">
            <h3>Basic User</h3>
            <p>This category is aimed at users who simply want a good all-around computer without breaking the bank. A
                PC for a basic user needs to brows the web, check emails, stream videos, and maybe some light gaming
                (not suitable for 3D AAA games).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gamer userType">
            <img src="./imgs/SVG/gamer.svg" alt="Gamer" class="userTypeIcon">
            <h3>The Gamer</h3>
            <p>The name of this category speaks for itself, a gaming computer. A gaming PC can range widely in price
                based on the users desire, its all about the FPS. A PC for this user should easily do everything a
                basic computer can do as well run the latest games at minimum 1080 resolution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="professional userType">
            <img src="./imgs/SVG/professional.svg" alt="The Professional" class="userTypeIcon">
            <h3>The Professional</h3>
            <p>This category is for the more specific user that will generally use this PC for
                graphically &#x2F computationally demanding work. Special consideration may be required when choosing
                the
                processor and graphics card based on the type of work. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="nextPageText">
            <span class="highlight">Ok so hopefully you have a better idea of what kind of user you are and what you
                will require of your PC. When your ready lets dive in to the components! </span>
